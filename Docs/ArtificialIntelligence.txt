## -- What we want -- ##

- One function/method for all 10 opposing teams

- Make the AI buy drivers designated for that team automatically at the start of the season

- Make the AI buy car upgrades when possible to compete with the other teams

-------------------------------------------------------

## -- What we want (optional) -- ##



-------------------------------------------------------

## -- How I want to do it -- ##

- When using the function/method, give it a variable when accessing it (Team ID)
	+ For example, updateTeam(int TeamID) {}

- When starting the season, make the team automatically buy their normal drivers.
	+ If the function is processing Mercedes and Hamilton is taken by user, select one of the non-chosen 2 drivers

- When the Team of the AI has more than 25million dollars, make it buy upgrades.
	+ For loop, while (balance>25'000'000) { Buy one of the 5 possible upgrades if ((balance - upgrade) > 0) }
	^ instean of using a loop just check the balance and let them buy an upgrade after every, game.
