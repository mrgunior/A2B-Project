Reflection
1. Productivity week 2.2
   Most tasks are done. Brainstorming simulation (must have) should be finished.
   Skeleton report (must have) has less priority at this moment, but is not much work. 
   Team work is going well. 

   Adjustments:
   Uploading files to GitHub should happen on schedule.
   Maven should be installed and working.

2. Planning and assignment week 2.3

Discussion of topics/tasks Bas presented:
- Demo is next week Monday (5-12-2016).
  Deliverables:
  Demo should be in the master branch.
  Mockup GUI (should work)
  Main menu is not required, but a basic setup is appreciated.
  GUI storyboard is necessary and 2 buttons with back/next function should be implemented. 
  Singleton: creating object of windows and loading them in one main window (changing from window)
  Dynamic loading: only loading things when you really need them. 
- Read/Write to JSON should be ready, ability to load the gamestate should be present.
- Ability to save the gamestate

  Testing:
  When reading and writing files, test that the data that is read is equal to the written data.

  Tasks:
  Each member should continue to work on and improve previous work.

3. Client expectations/renegotiations

Adjustments week 2.3
- UML should make a clear distinction between Model, View and Controller.
  The model is the data, the view is GUI and the controller is the gateway between MVC model and application logic.
  Tip: use packages!
- UML: gamestate should be changed to gamecontroller.
- Uploaded images on GitHub should be moved to Google Drive (if necessary).
- Each member should be able to run the main application. Fix all problems as soon as possible.
