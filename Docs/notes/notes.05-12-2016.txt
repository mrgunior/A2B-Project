Nichelle is sick at home

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Meeting:
  - No more editing to the code right before a demo or presentation !!!
  - During the meeting we each said what our tasks from last week were, including the time it took to finish these tasks.
  - It's good if someone takes the initiative to help others when his own tasks are not enough to fill the weekly 10h.
  - Everyone takes his own time to do something, but don't let your hours depend on other work, make a list of things that have to be done and do them.
  - It's not needed for someone who doesn't work at someone to understand every single line, do learn the global function though.
  - Make sure you commit/push your work before there is a meeting, even if you are going to be sick !!!
  - It's good we use Trello as tool, update the Trello cards when the day is over.

  - JSON Read/Write demo:
    - Nichelle has the demo, but is sick so we couldn't deliver it.

  -Application demo:
    - Change the program so every menu is not a screen on it's own, or doesn't look like it.
    - Forgot the car/team customization screen !!!
    - Program is nice, clean and not too busy.
    - Missing summary of personal and AI data !!!

-------------------------------------------------------------------

What to do next:
  - Change the window within the scene, or look up how to do this.
    - Our program doesn't create a new window, it goes from fullscreen to windowed, back to fullscreen on a new screen.
    - Conclusion: We need to fix the fullscreen/windowed switching when going back or forth.
  - Important that we keep working on the GUI, since it is one of the main aspects of the game, and needs to be done before you are starting with code.
    - Is the application done?
      -  No? See where you can help, because a GUI is important
      - Yes? Great!
    - Conclusion: Finish the GUI asap

  - Race simulation
    - During the race you'll use a lot of parameters, weather, car specs, driver stats etc.
    - Create a class which has all results of the race, sorted by time. Created before the race starts.
    - During the simulation, change those values with small changes based on the race track and weather etc.
    - This way you can keep adding unique parameters, instead of having a formula for each race track.
    - Conclusion: Keep track of results before the race simulation even starts, then change those results with the race parameters.

  - Simulation Formula
    - There is no need for a specific formula that has a nice time.
    - You can just create a rank where the players finish, and make some fake finishing times based on those results.
    - Conclusion: No need for complicated formula's, you can make your work alot easier.

Client Expectations/Discussion

  - Feedback on our group:
    - We are a small group, but we're doing well.
    - Happy with the GUI, but it's lacking features
    - There's good communication within the group.
    - No notes of improvement.
    - Not the best group but that's because of the group size.
