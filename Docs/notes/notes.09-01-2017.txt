What did we do last week and what are we going to do. 
Mika: I made the simulation gui and the result that is read from an object and real time upgedate kan worden. 
Time was also added for each race how long it took

Rowdy: i didn't do alot but worked mostly on the code. And were fixes necassary.

Victor: I worked on the GameController, JSON, auto-save, test-cases & UML

to have a complete working and passing project, making sure all the basic components are there and any functionality that is
need should be added. Make sure for next week these things are done and for the week after that only bug fixes and testing
don't add anything else otherwise the game might just not work. 

the report is not just to show that you can code but that you can also can give if you have grown as a 
software engineer. Also why did you use certain technologies, and we also don't expect to put any code in the report. 
Presentation you need to make sure you work on in in the last 2 weeks. 

Test cases are not only being judged on the precentage but also how are you testing your classes.

Make sure the game works. Apart from a beautiful gui but that it can be playable. From start to the beginning. 
So make sure you see what needs to be done and what is still missing. Very important. As said make sure this week 
it is complete. 

the group asked question related to the rubric. Relating to maven, EclEmma, report, mockito, pull based development 
and continous integration. Bas also explained what mock is. How it can be used to test if for example certain methods 
are being called and more in dept.
