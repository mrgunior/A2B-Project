first point: secretary
second point: respect, help eachother find solutions, also pay attention (if something is taking too much time)

Bas is customer and is the one checking the status of the process of the application
If there are problems related with code please ask bas for assistance
if something else you can speak to him personally or mail him

One of the important things: working together as a team
the reason for this is because working together is the base of the science world.
and you will be communicating in your daily life with different people

If you are not able to come please let the TA know on time
if you are leaving the team please let the team know on time, this will releave stress and confusion.
maven is obligated to be used.

branching is really useful for implementing

MVC for this application for this application, keeping the gui separated from the logic.
Git ignore and you add all the IDE's and what are being used.

MoSCoW, must have, should have, could have and would have.
This can be used to scale down the broader view of the whole project. Implementing the basics and having them working is
very important. If it works you can always add it later.

Road map will have the priority of the tasks that need to be done. 
Creating a sprint not only for the first week but also for the upcoming weeks. Create a backlog with items that way you know which 
items you can tackle.
Google drive is also handy for editing docx related file. 

Toggle also very handy to keep track of how much you are spending on a project.
Very important points to take account of which are tasks:
Gui sketches, roadmap, sketches, Tools in use by everyone, brainstorming simulation, game data, gui architecture & HDD storage.

brainstorming -> see what you will have and what you will be doing.
game data -> uml of the application
gui architecture -> open new window/or reopen in the same window. MVC 
HDD storage -> json
